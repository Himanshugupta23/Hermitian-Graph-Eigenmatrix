# Hermitian-Graph-Eigenmatrix
On the eigenvalues of Grassmann graphs, Bilinear forms graphs and Hermitian forms graphs, Sebastian M. Cioaba and Himanshu Gupta.

HermitianFormGraph.ipynb is a code written in the programming language Sagemath https://www.sagemath.org/. We use the jupyter notebook for it.

HermitianFormGraph.pdf is the pdf file after we run the code. So it contains the outputs. 

Conjecture 1.3
 1) If j is odd, then Q_j(1) \leq Q_j(i) for 0 \leq i \leq d.
 2) If j is even, j \geq 2, then Q_j(d-j+2) \leq Q_j(i) for 0 \leq i \leq d.

Conjecture 1.4 

Let d\geq 3. Then |Q_j(i)| < |Q_j(1)| for 2 \leq i \leq d.
