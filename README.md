# Hermitian-Graph-Eigenmatrix
On the eigenvalues of Grassmann graphs, Bilinear forms graphs and Hermitian forms graphs, Sebastian M. Cioaba and Himanshu Gupta.

HermitianFormGraph.ipynb is the code written in the programming language Sagemath https://www.sagemath.org/. We use the jupyter notebook for it.

HermitianFormGraph.pdf is the pdf file after we run the code. So it contain the outputs.
